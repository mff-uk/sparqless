# List of active/maintained SPARQL endpoints

## SPARQLES

[SPARQL Endpoint Status](https://github.com/pyvandenbussche/sparqles) is a project
developed to monitor the availability, performance, interoperability
and discoverability of public SPARQL endpoints. There is an instance of it hosted
by the Vienna University of Economics and Business [here](https://sparqles.ai.wu.ac.at/availability).

This instance contains mutiple years' worth of data on SPARQL
endpoints which are registered on [datahub.io](https://datahub.io).
As of February 2022, 109 of 565 tracked endpoints were marked
as available and operating normally. However, some of these
endpoints are simply different-language versions of other
endpoints, or versions of the same dataset across multiple
institutions.

Regardless, this list is useful for filtering out endpoints
which do not even respond to requests.

## List of verified endpoints we used

The following is a curated list of endpoints which we used during
our research. These endpoints are confirmed to be fully functional
and available, and they contain meaningful data.
