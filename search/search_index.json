These datasets are often also available as JSON or RDF dumps, but having to write code to explore them can be cumbersome. SPARQL2GraphQL aims to make it easier to use these datasets by providing a tool which will give developers a more friendly interface which they likely already know how to use - GraphQL. Simply configure SPARQL2GraphQL with the URL of a SPARQL endpoint which has some data which interests you, and let it do its magic.

Installing dependencies The project is written in Typescript and uses Node.js as its runtime. You will need to have the following installed before you proceed with usage: Node 16.13.0 (Gallium LTS) - easily managed with nvm npm Once you have installed them, run npm install in the project root directory to install all required dependencies with npm. Edit configuration There is one required configuration step before you run the project - configuring the SPARQL endpoint you want to run. In config.ts , set the value ENDPOINT_TO_RUN to refer to your endpoint. There is a pre-defined list of endpoints in endpoints.ts in case you just want to try the project without having a specific SPARQL endpoint in mind, but you can easily define your own like so: export const ENDPOINT_TO_RUN = { url: 'https://data.europa.eu/sparql', name: 'European Data', }; The name can be whatever you want, it's just an easily readable identifier used in logs. There are other configuration values which you are free to modify, but they have sensible defaults in case you just want to get started. Run it After everything is configured, run npm start to start SPARQL2GraphQL. In the logs, you will see that it will first run some observations on the target endpoint to collect information about its schema and the data contained within. This may take a while, especially for large datasets, depending on the configuration parameters used. After observation is finished, you will see that a fully functional GraphQL interface is available for you to explore at the configured port (http://localhost:4000 by default).","title":"Usage"},{"location":"usage/#usage-guide","text":"This page will explain how to set up SPARQL2GraphQL for a given SPARQL endpoint, step-by-step.","title":"Usage guide"},{"location":"usage/#installing-dependencies","text":"The project is written in Typescript and uses Node.js as its runtime.
